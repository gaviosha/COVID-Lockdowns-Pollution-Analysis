## Downloading sensor data

To download NO2 and O3 concentrations for all European cities between the years 2018-2021 from the European Environmental Agency run `scrape_EU_air_quality_data.py` from the repository root. 

## Cleaning sensor data

To clean sensor data run the chunk below. Cleaned data is saved in `../data/clean`. Cleaning sensor does the following:  

* At each sensor location hourly observations are used to obtain daily averages
* From each city data is avereaged over sensor locations to obtain a time series of hourly city wide average

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("../R/clean_sensor_data.R")
setwd("../data")

clean.pollutant.data(pollutant = "NO2")
clean.pollutant.data(pollutant = "O3")
```
